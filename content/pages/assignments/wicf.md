To Be Presented in SES #4 and SES #5
------------------------------------

In SES #4 and SES #5 you will all present to the class your digital story "Where I Come From." I hope very much that you will enjoy this foray into digital storytelling.

You've seen examples of such stories in class. They are models for you of what the possibilities are, but you shouldn't feel limited by what you saw in those models. Rather, the sky is the limit! You can write a poem, if you like, or tell a more conventional narrative. What's important is that you focus on _images_ that convey the meaning of "home" to you.

**On the day you present your digital story to the class, be sure to bring me a written copy of what your voice-over will be on your digital story**.
